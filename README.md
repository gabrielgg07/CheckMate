TODO:
Add Friends functionality.
Clear use of backend push notification. Right now there is a route in the backend that will send a notification to a user based on the device token or something but its not actually included in teh frontend.
You can test it by finding the device token and sening a curl requst to that route. 
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND DIFFERENC EBETWEEN APNS DEVICE TOKEN IN PROD AND DEV!
There are no security measures
